## 🧭 How to Use

1. In the WordPress admin panel, go to  
   **Image Weight Tracker** in the sidebar.
2. Click **"Re-scan"** to start analyzing all published content.
3. Wait for the scan to complete (progress indicator shows status).
4. Review the results in the table:
   - **Red badges** = Heavy images (> 500KB)
   - **Yellow badges** = Medium images (150-500KB)
   - **Green badges** = Optimal images (≤ 150KB)
5. Use the **filters** to focus on specific formats or status categories.
6. Click on **"Page – Post"** links to see where each image is used.

The plugin provides analysis data; you'll need to optimize images manually or with a separate optimization tool.

## 🧰 Technical Notes

- Image sizes are detected using `filesize()` for local files and `wp_remote_head()` / `wp_remote_get()` for external URLs.  
- Results are cached in WordPress transients with a 24-hour TTL:  
  `wpoiwt_sz_{md5_hash}`  
- Batch processing prevents memory issues on large sites (default: 25 posts per batch).  
- Content is processed through a custom hook `wpoiwt_the_content` that applies standard WordPress filters.  
- Compatible with **multisite** installations (can be activated per site).  
- Follows **WordPress Coding Standards** (PHPCS validated).  

---

## ⚠️ Recommendations

- **Backup your database** before making bulk image changes based on scan results.  
- For sites with 10,000+ images, the initial scan may take several minutes.  
- External images require HTTP requests; slow CDNs may affect scan speed.  
- Use the filters to focus on specific categories instead of reviewing all images at once.  
- Re-scan after uploading new content or optimizing images to see updated results.
